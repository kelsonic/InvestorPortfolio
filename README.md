## History

This is a coding challenge from a FinTech startup for a frontend position in the US.

## TODOs

1. In the app's current form, the pie chart is not keeping track of the real-time value of the stocks in the portfolio. Instead, it is displaying the price paid for each stock compared to the available cash you have left.

2. For each component, a styles file should be created that contains the specific styles for the particular component.
